# 1. Project Objective

The objective of this project is to estimate the intrinsic equity value of NVIDIA using a rigorous, bottom-up DCF framework. The model is designed to replicate institutional valuation standards, integrating detailed financial forecasting, capital efficiency analysis, and scenario-based risk assessment.

# 2. Data Foundation & Financial Statements

The valuation is built on historical financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement), which were cleaned, standardized, and aligned to ensure consistency across periods. These statements form the backbone of all forward-looking assumptions and cash flow projections.

# 3. Working Capital Framework

## A granular working capital analysis was conducted to enhance the precision of free cash flow estimation. Key operating efficiency metrics include:

### Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) – receivables efficiency

### Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) – inventory turnover and demand alignment

### Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) – supplier financing efficiency

### Other Current Assets (% of Revenue)

### Accrued & Other Current Liabilities (% of Operating Expenses)

These drivers were integrated to compute the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC), enabling a realistic projection of net working capital requirements and their impact on cash flows across different growth scenarios.

# 4. Fixed Assets & Capital Allocation Analysis

## Reinvestment assumptions were validated through a cross-comparison of net purchases of Property & Equipment and Intangible Assets with reported values in the Cash Flow Statement. This ensured that projected capital expenditures and asset growth were grounded in historical capital allocation behavior and operational scalability.

# 5. Forecasting Methodology

## Key operating and cost line items were forecasted as percentages of revenue, maintaining internal consistency and scalability. The model captures:

### Revenue growth dynamics

### Margin evolution

### Reinvestment intensity

### Operating leverage across growth scenarios

This driver-based approach supports transparent assumption testing and scenario flexibility.

# 6. Scenario Analysis

## To account for uncertainty and asymmetry in future performance, the valuation incorporates three distinct scenarios:

### Conservative – downside growth and margin assumptions

### Base Case – normalized operating performance

### Optimistic – accelerated growth and margin expansion

Each scenario applies differentiated revenue growth rates and operating assumptions, allowing for a structured assessment of downside risk and upside potential.

# 7. Terminal Value Estimation

## Terminal value was calculated using the Perpetuity Growth Method, applying a sustainable long-term growth rate consistent with macroeconomic conditions and NVIDIA’s competitive positioning.

# 8. Valuation Output & Insights

## The model derives:

### Enterprise value and equity value across scenarios

### Implied intrinsic share price for each case

### Sensitivity of valuation to key drivers such as growth rates and cost of capital

This enables a direct comparison between intrinsic value and market pricing, supporting informed investment judgment.

# 9. Key Takeaway

### This project demonstrates a disciplined, institution-style valuation process, combining financial statement analysis, working capital efficiency, scenario modeling, and intrinsic valuation. The framework is designed to be transparent, scalable, and decision-oriented, mirroring real-world equity valuation and investment analysis workflows.
